## 🎯 Goal

- Build a **Smart Vibe Shuffle system** that **automatically selects the next song matching the current song’s vibe** to maintain mood consistency while preserving shuffle variety.
    

---

## 🪄 Success Criteria

✅ Automatically suggests the next song in your library based on:

- Loudness
    
- Tempo
    
- Mood/tonality
    
- Acoustic/energy balance  
    ✅ Runs **locally on low-end machines** without GPU.  
    ✅ Usable without interrupting your workflow (background-friendly).  
    ✅ Integrates with Android + Windows/Linux player via **React Native + Electron** apps.

-  Design and build **Electron app** for desktop:
    
    - Playlist management
        
    - Vibe-based shuffle control
        
-  Design and build **React Native app**:
    
    - Library sync
        
    - Smart shuffle button
        
-  Add skip feedback learning for improved suggestions.
    
-  Testing with daily music sessions.
    
-  Polish UI/UX for MVP launch.

## 🔄 Phases

-  **Research**
    
    - Study additional lightweight features (danceability, energy via Spotify API).
        
    - Review local music player APIs for integration.
        
    - Examine React Native audio player options.
        
-  **MVP**
    
    - Local CLI + Electron/React Native prototype.
        
    - Smart shuffle on a local folder of music.
        
-  **Testing**
    
    - Check responsiveness during active coding.
        
    - Vibe accuracy during long shuffle sessions.
        
    - Memory/CPU usage optimization.
        
-  **Deployment**
    
    - Package Electron app with auto-updates.
        
    - Package React Native APK for local sideloading.

## 🛠️ Resources

**Languages & Frameworks:**

- Python (feature extraction + API microservice)
    
- React Native (Android app)
    
- Electron + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui (Desktop app)
    
- SQLite / TinyDB (local storage)
    

**Libraries:**

- `librosa`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `torch` (optional)
    
- `FastAPI` or `Flask`
    
- `ffmpeg` (audio preprocessing)
    

**Tools:**

- VS Code / Neovim
    
- GitHub for versioning
    
- CapCut for quick video dev logs (optional)
    

---

## 🧩 Ideas

- Add **user mood tagging** for songs to fine-tune vibe mapping.
    
- Add a **“mood drift” slider** allowing slow vibe transitions over time.
    
- Integrate with **MPD / VLC / Spotify local player API** for seamless control.
    
- Add **visualizations**: energy over time, mood graphs.
    
- Optional **LLM-based tagging** for lyrics sentiment analysis.

## 🪞 Reflection Notes

- This project solves a **real personal pain point**, ensuring high motivation.
    
- Lightweight pipeline approach lets you start **using it early**, iterating gradually.
    
- Provides a **showcase project** for your portfolio demonstrating:
    
    - DSP feature engineering
        
    - Algorithm design
        
    - Cross-platform app development
        
    - System design under low-resource constraints
        
- Potential for expansion into a **micro SaaS** for musicians or productivity-focused listeners.

## 💻 Tech Stack Recommendation (aligned with your goals)

✅ **Backend & Core Logic:**

- Python for feature extraction (offloaded to background or on app startup).
    
- FastAPI or Flask for a lightweight local API for Electron + React Native to call.
    
- SQLite for persistent storage.
    

✅ **Frontend:**

- **Electron + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui**:
    
    - For Windows/Linux desktop app.
        
    - Allows advanced filtering, manual playlist override, statistics display.
        
    - Integrate `howler.js` or system calls to control playback.
        
- **React Native + Expo**:
    
    - For Android app.
        
    - Use `expo-av` or `react-native-track-player` for playback.
        
    - Offline-first with background feature extraction syncing.
        

✅ **Optional:**

- Tauri instead of Electron if you want lower RAM usage for desktop.
    
- Node.js service if you prefer JS pipeline instead of Python.

## **Recommended Approach for Your Workflow:**

✅ **Phase 1 (Week 1–2):**

- Implement and test Python-based feature extraction & similarity matching CLI.
    
- Tag a 100–200 song dataset.
    

✅ **Phase 2 (Week 3–4):**

- Build local FastAPI service to expose song suggestion endpoint.
    
- Build Electron app for local testing and control.
    

✅ **Phase 3 (Week 5–7):**

- Develop React Native app, test on your phone.
    
- Refine UI/UX and performance for everyday use.
    

✅ **Phase 4 (Week 8):**

- Final polish, add optional skip feedback, packaging for daily use.

If you want, I can now prepare:

✅ **Next Action: Draft the `feature_extraction.py` and `similarity_matcher.py` to start testing on your local library today while you continue your other work.**
